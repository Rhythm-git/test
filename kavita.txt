this is the first line of the kavita.txt
and it is very appealing 
as the writer has provided beautiful figure of speech and grammar in the story lines
the lines were immaculate and the vibe was charming
the poem was a bliss that is all i would say it was a once in a lifetiem experience and i wish i could get more poems like this so that we can experience it forever
